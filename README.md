# Enonic 5 M4 Lab project

This project is an Enonic Lab project aimed to train consultants in Enonic 5 and give valuable feedback to further
development of the platform.

Task
Each consultant will pick a finished responsive theme (make sure it's open source and no strings attached) and implement
this theme in Enonic 5 using Thymeleaf as the template engine. We want the most used grid frameworks to be tested, use
different ones (i.e. Twitter Bootstrap).

* Scope the project to make sure you can demo the theme
* Create one single module
* Add module form with the appropriate settings and content
* Add appropriate pages, parts, layouts and image components
* Create at least four layout components
* Add forms to configure each page and component
* Development environment
* Setup a local environment for each consultant.

#Quick demo of all themes
* Highlight improvements for developers
* Highlight general UI feedback
* Misc
* There will be changes to the Javascript API in M5, meaning the core you produce won't run on future versions without
some changes. The current API is just a reflection of Java, and we want it to be cooler.
